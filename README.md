Pestering Protocol for social media users

## ISMP

1. on the internet, no one can `\hear` you `\yell`
    1. so, you are most welcome to `\try`
        1. now, now, don’t be shy
            1. but you are, aren’t you?
        1. what do you `\mean,` “never stopped”?
            1. I would have heard
    1. now, as you `\yell,` take heed
        1. you can’t: you’re yelling
        1. shh!
1. on the internet, everybody yells
    1. that is why nobody hears no one
        1. you’ve just changed that, right?
    1. there are exceptions, after all
        1. not for you, no
1. when you say to yourself, “Nobody gives a damn”
    1. you actually broadcast
        1. where broadcast is a formal referense to `\yell`
        1. which, in turn is semantic sugar to say(self, $words) 
    1. nobody is an alias referring to \[@someone, @quite, @specific\]
        1. they might actually give more than a damn
            1. they might even have told you so
            1. while you were, you know, yelling
        1. but they probably hadn't
            1. might've been `\busy` 
            1. or they did broadcast it `#you see, broadcast had to be 
                1. to someone else
                
                    
        1. you'll never know for sure
            1. unless you try, at least
